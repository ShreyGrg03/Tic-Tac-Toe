# Programming Assignment : 2-player-game

## Overview

This assignment involves creating a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should allow players to take turns, display the current game status, and provide an option to reset the game at any time.

## Game Description

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game played on a 3x3 grid by two players who alternately place their marks (X or O) in empty squares. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with three of one's own marks.
